  "summary": "The diff implements a significant portion of both REQ-1 and REQ-2. The frontend HomePage.tsx is restored with hero section, promo banner, flight search, featured destinations, domestic/international tour packages, blog posts, testimonials, and other sections. The backend main.mo includes hardcoded featured destinations (domestic and international). A migration module is added. However, some acceptance criteria cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff, particularly around complete backend data restoration for REQ-2 (all travel package records, flights, blog posts, testimonial records) and confirmation that all version 28 sections are present (the HomePage.tsx is truncated).",

      "reason": "The backend/main.mo is truncated and only shows type definitions and empty Maps (Map.empty) for packages, flights, blogPosts, and testimonials. While hardcoded domesticFeatured and internationalFeatured destination arrays are partially visible, there is no evidence of hardcoded seed data being populated into the packages, flights, blogPosts, or testimonials maps. The migration module only passes through the old actor state without adding missing records.",
