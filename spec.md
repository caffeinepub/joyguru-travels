# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Restore the homepage layout, sections, and content from version 28 of the Joyguru Travels site, and ensure all associated backend data is present, without removing any features added in versions 29–32.

**Planned changes:**
- Restore all version 28 homepage sections including hero, promotional banners, domestic tour packages, international tour packages, flight search, destinations, blog posts, and testimonials
- Ensure all version 28 sections coexist alongside any sections added in versions 29–32
- Restore any missing backend data (destinations, travel packages, flights, blog posts, testimonials) that existed in version 28 but are absent in the current version

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage displays all sections from version 28 alongside current features, and all version 28 data records are fully present in the backend with no content regression.
